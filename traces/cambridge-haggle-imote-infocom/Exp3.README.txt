of accidental hardware reset. Contacts with any of these were discarded
from the traces of other iMotes to avoid any consequence on the
experimental results.

- The first six hours were discarded, as people were attending the same workshop during the first afternoon. 

- Details of ID number:
	ID 1-41 are corresponding to iMotes (Class 1)
	ID 42-274 corresponds to external devices (Class 2)
